This dir contains the data for training/testing a tone classifier.

train/              training data
test/               test data

Each dir includes the f0 and engery features extracted from 
corresponding wav files. Each wav file is the pronunciation of
a single Chinese character. 

Note that the length of different wav file may be different.
Hence, the f0/engy files corresponding to different character
may also have different length. 
But for the same character, the f0 file will have exactly the
same length as the engy file.


The naming convention for subdir and file names are as below:

1. subdir name indicates the correct tone. 
2. filename pattern is 

   {pron}{tone_lable}.f0
   {pron}{tone_lable}.engy

   where pron is the pronunciation of the character and tone_lable is the tone of that character, i.e. 1, 2, 3 or 4.

Please design a tone classifer with the f0/engy file as the input and output the tone label.
